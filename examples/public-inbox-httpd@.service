# ==> /etc/systemd/system/public-inbox-httpd@.service <==
# Since SIGUSR2 upgrades do not work under systemd, this service file
# allows starting two simultaneous services during upgrade time
# (e.g. public-inbox-httpd@1 public-inbox-httpd@2) with the intention
# that they take turns running in-between upgrades.  This should
# allow upgrading without downtime.
