public-inbox - an "archives first" approach to mailing lists
------------------------------------------------------------

public-inbox implements the sharing of an email inbox via git to
complement or replace traditional mailing lists.  Readers may
read via NNTP, Atom feeds or HTML archives.

public-inbox spawned around three main ideas:

* Publicly accessible and archived communication is essential to
  Free Software development.

* Contributing to Free Software projects should not require the
  use of non-Free services or software.

* Graphical user interfaces should not be required for text-based
  communication.

public-inbox aims to be easy-to-deploy and manage; encouraging projects
to run their own instances with minimal overhead.

Implementation
--------------

public-inbox uses ssoma[1], Some Sort Of Mail Archiver which implements
no policy of its own.  By storing (and optionally) exposing an inbox
via git, it is fast and efficient to host and mirror public-inboxes.

Traditional mailing lists use the "push" model.  For readers, this
requires commitment to subscribe and effort to unsubscribe.  New readers
may also have difficulty following existing discussions if archives do
not expose Message-ID headers for responses.  List server admins may be
burdened with delivery failures.

public-inbox uses the "pull" model.  Casual readers may also follow
the list via NNTP, Atom feed or HTML archives.

Users of the ssoma[1] command-line tool may import mail into an mbox,
Maildir, or IMAP folder from git repositories periodically.

If a reader loses interest, they simply stop syncing.

Since we use git, mirrors are easy-to-setup, and lists are
easy-to-relocate to different mail addresses without losing/splitting
archives.

_Anybody_ may also setup a delivery-only mailing list server to
replay a public-inbox git archive to subscribers via SMTP.

Features
--------

* anybody may participate via plain-text email

* stores email in git, readers may have a complete archive of the inbox

* Atom feed and NNTP allows casual readers to follow via feed reader

* uses only well-documented and easy-to-implement data formats

Try it out now, see http://try.public-inbox.org/

Requirements for reading:

* any software capable of NNTP or following Atom feeds

Any basic web browser will do for the HTML archives.
We primarily develop on w3m to maximize accessibility.

Requirements (participant)
--------------------------

* any MUA which may send text-only emails ("git send-email" works!)
  Users are strongly encouraged to use the "reply-all" feature of
  their mailers to reduce the impact of a public-inbox as a
  single point of failure.

* participants do not need to install public-inbox, only server admins

Requirements (server)
---------------------

Hacking
-------

Source code is available via git:

	git clone git://80x24.org/public-inbox

See below for contact info.

Contact
-------

We are happy to see feedback of all types via plain-text email.
public-inbox discussion is self-hosting on public-inbox.org
Please send comments, user/developer discussion, patches, bug reports,
and pull requests to our public-inbox address at:

	meta@public-inbox.org

Please Cc: all recipients when replying as we do not require
subscription.  This also makes it easier to rope in folks of
tangentially related projects we depend on (e.g. git developers
on git@vger.kernel.org).

The archives are readable via NNTP or HTTP:

	nntp://news.public-inbox.org/inbox.comp.mail.public-inbox.meta
	http://public-inbox.org/meta/

You may also clone all messages via git:

	git clone --mirror git://public-inbox.org/meta.git

Or pass the same git repository URL for ssoma using the instructions at:

	http://ssoma.public-inbox.org/README.html

Anti-Spam
---------

The maintainer of public-inbox has found SpamAssassin a good tool for
filtering his personal mail, and it will be the default spam filtering
tool in public-inbox.

See http://public-inbox.org/dc-dlvr-spam-flow.html for more info.

Content Filtering
-----------------

To discourage phishing, web bugs (tracking), viruses and other nuisances,
only plain-text content is allowed and non-text content is stripped.
This saves I/O bandwidth and storage, which is important as
entire mail archives are shared between clients.

As of the 2010s, successful online social networks and forums are the
ones which heavily restrict users formatting options; so public-inbox
aims to preserve the focus on content, and not presentation.
