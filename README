public-inbox - shared mailboxes via git for public discussion
-------------------------------------------------------------

public-inbox is an "archives first" approach to mailing lists.
It implements the sharing of an email inbox to complement or replace
traditional mailing lists.  public-inbox is primarily intended as a
Free, distributed public communications tool for users and developers of
Free and Open Source Software.  public-inbox should be easy-to-deploy
and manage; encouraging software projects to run their own instances
with minimal overhead.

Implementation
--------------
public-inbox uses ssoma[1], Some Sort Of Mail Archiver which implements
no policy of its own.  By exposing an inbox via git, readers may follow
the mailing list without subscribing via SMTP and have easy access to
old messages.

Traditional mailing lists use the "push" model.  List servers deliver
content via SMTP to other mail servers used by readers of the mailing
list.  For readers, this requires commitment to subscribe to the list
and extra effort to unsubscribe.  New readers may also have difficulty
following existing discussions if archives do not expose Message-ID
headers for responses.  List server admins are also burdened with
occasional bounce messages.

public-inbox uses the "pull" model.  Readers import mail into an mbox,
Maildir, or IMAP folder from git repositories periodically.  If a reader
loses interest, they simply stop syncing.  Since ssoma uses git,
mirrors are easy-to-setup, and lists are easy-to-relocate to different
mail addresses without losing/splitting archives.  Dedicated readers
only need to install ssoma, a command-line tool[1] currently implemented
in Perl.

Casual readers may also follow the list via Atom feed or web archives.

_Anybody_ may also setup a delivery-only mailing list server to replay
a public-inbox git archive to subscribers via SMTP.

Features
--------
* anybody may participate via plain-text email to the public address
* stores email in git, readers have a full archive of the mailing list
* Atom feed allows casual readers to follow via feed reader
* Mail user-agent (MUA) users may use Maildir, mbox(5) and/or IMAP locally
* uses only well-documented and easy-to-implement data formats

Requirements (Atom, read-only client)
-------------------------------------
* any feed reader capable of following Atom feeds

Requirements (participant)
--------------------------
* ssoma - http://ssoma.public-inbox.org/INSTALL
* any MUA which may send text-only emails ("git send-email" works!)
* participants do not need to install public-inbox, only server admins

Requirements (server)
---------------------
See INSTALL

Hacking
-------
Source code is available via git:

	git clone git://bogomips.org/public-inbox

See below for contact info.

Contact
-------
We are happy to see feedback of all types via plain-text email.
public-inbox discussion is self-hosting on public-inbox.org
Please send comments, user/developer discussion, patches, bug reports,
and pull requests to our public-inbox address at:

	bugs@public-inbox.org

Please Cc: all recipients when replying as we do not require
subscription.  This also makes it easier to rope in folks of
tangentially related projects we depend on (e.g. git developers
on git@vger.kernel.org).

You can subscribe via ssoma(1), LISTNAME is a name of your choosing:

    URL=git://git.public-inbox.org/public-inbox
    LISTNAME=public-inbox

    # to initialize a maildir (this may be a new or existing maildir,
    # ssoma will not touch existing messages)
    # If you prefer mbox, use "ssoma add mbox ..." instead
    ssoma add $LISTNAME $URL maildir:/path/to/maildir/

    # read with your favorite MUA (only using mutt as an example)
    mutt -f /path/to/maildir # (or /path/to/mbox)

    # to keep your mbox or maildir up-to-date, periodically run the following:
    ssoma sync $LISTNAME

    # your MUA may modify and delete messages from the maildir or mbox,
    # this does not affect ssoma functionality at all

    # to sync all your ssoma subscriptions
    ssoma sync

Anti-Spam
---------
The maintainer of public-inbox has found SpamAssassin a good tool for
filtering his personal mail, and it will be the default spam filtering
tool in public-inbox.

Readers may also use a custom mail-delivery-agent for delivery to enable
spam filtering by having ssoma deliver to a command via pipe.

There is unlikely to be any tool which is 100% accurate at classifying
spam, so it is possible to remove messages using the ssoma-rm(1) tool
in ssoma.

Content Filtering
-----------------
To discourage phishing, web bugs (tracking), viruses and other nuisances,
only plain-text content is allowed and non-text content is stripped.
This saves I/O bandwidth and storage, which is important as
entire mail archives are shared between clients.

As of the 2010s, successful online social networks and forums are the
ones which heavily restrict users formatting options; so public-inbox
aims to preserve the focus on content, and not presentation.
