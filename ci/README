various scripts for automated testing in chroots/VMs/jails

TL;DR: ./ci/run.sh

By default, `sudo' is used to install/uninstall packages.  It may be
overridden with the `SUDO' environment variable.  These scripts should
run in the top-level source tree, that is, as `./ci/run.sh'.

* ci/run.sh - runs tests against all profiles for the current OS

	Environment options may override behavior:

	* DO - may be set to ":" to print commands instead of running
	       default: "" (empty)

	Common commands can be overridden by the environment, too:

	* MAKE - default: "make"
	* PERL - default: "perl"
	* SUDO - default: "sudo"

* ci/deps.perl - script to mass-install/remove packages (requires root/sudo)

	Called automatically by ci/run.sh

	There is no need to run this manually unless you are debugging
	or doing development.  However, it can be convenient to for
	users to mass-install several packages.

* ci/profiles.sh - prints to-be tested package profile for the current OS

	Called automatically by ci/run.sh
	The output is read by ci/run.sh
