various scripts for automated testing in chroots/VMs/jails

TL;DR: ./ci/run.sh

By default, `sudo' is used to run install/deps.perl to install/uninstall
packages.  It may be overridden with the `SUDO' environment variable.
These scripts should run in the top-level source tree, that is, as
`./ci/run.sh'.

* ci/run.sh - runs tests against all profiles for the current OS

	Environment options may override behavior:

	* DO - may be set to ":" to print commands instead of running
	       default: "" (empty)

	Common commands can be overridden by the environment, too:

	* MAKE - default: "make"
	* PERL - default: "perl"
	* SUDO - default: "sudo"

* install/deps.perl - see install/README

	Called automatically by ci/run.sh

* ci/profiles.perl - prints to-be-tested package profile for the current OS

	Called automatically by ci/run.sh
	The output is read by ci/run.sh
