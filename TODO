TODO items for public-inbox

(Not in any particular order)

* Optional reply-to-list support for mirroring lists that want it :<
  Reply-to-list encourages the existing list as a single-point-of-failure,
  but having an extra mirror using public-inbox.org is nice regardless.

* Configurable linkification for per-inbox shorthands:
  "$gmane/123456" could be configured to expand to the
  appropriate link pointing to the gmane.org list archives,
  likewise "[Bug #123456]" could be configured to expand to
  point to some project's bug tracker at http://example.com/bug/123456

* implement RFC 4685 (Atom message threading)

* configurable constants (quote folding, index limits)

* use tags as date-based skiplists for navigating history
  (maybe not needed with Xapian support nowadays?)

* handle Xapian date range queries:
  http://mid.gmane.org/20151005222157.GE5880@survex.com

* use REQUEST_URI properly for CGI / mod_perl2 compatibility
  with Message-IDs which include '%'

* more test cases (use git fast-import to speed up creation)

* large mbox/Maildir/MH/NNTP spool import (use git fast-import)

* remove dependency on ssoma installation (inline the code)

* improve + document mlmmj integration, currently only at:
  http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/20140508084301.GA2033%40dcvr.yhbt.net/
