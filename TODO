TODO items for public-inbox

(Not in any particular order)

* Optional cookies in WWW interface for user-configurable colors

* WWW: Hybrid flat view + thread skeleton (requires Xapian)

* POP3 server, since some webmail providers support external POP3:
  https://public-inbox.org/meta/20160411034104.GA7817@dcvr.yhbt.net/

* TLS support for various daemons (including STARTTLS for NNTP and POP3)

* Unix socket support for HTTP and POP3 server for use behind reverse
  proxies like nginx

* Combined "super server" for NNTP/HTTP/POP3 to reduce memory overhead

* Optional reply-to-list support for mirroring lists that want it :<
  Reply-to-list encourages the existing list as a single-point-of-failure,
  but having an extra mirror using public-inbox.org is nice regardless.

* Configurable linkification for per-inbox shorthands:
  "$gmane/123456" could be configured to expand to the
  appropriate link pointing to the gmane.org list archives,
  likewise "[Bug #123456]" could be configured to expand to
  point to some project's bug tracker at http://example.com/bug/123456

* implement RFC 4685 (Atom message threading)

* configurable constants (index limits, search results)

* use tags as date-based skiplists for navigating history
  (maybe not needed with Xapian support nowadays?)

* handle Xapian date range queries:
  http://mid.gmane.org/20151005222157.GE5880@survex.com

* use REQUEST_URI properly for CGI / mod_perl2 compatibility
  with Message-IDs which include '%' (done?)

* more test cases (use git fast-import to speed up creation)

* large mbox/Maildir/MH/NNTP spool import (use git fast-import)

* improve + document mlmmj integration, currently only at:
  http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/20140508084301.GA2033%40dcvr.yhbt.net/
