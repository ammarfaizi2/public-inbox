TODO items for public-inbox

(Not in any particular order)

* mailmap support (same as git) for remapping expired email addresses

* Optional cookies in WWW interface for user-configurable colors

* WWW: Hybrid flat view + thread skeleton (requires Xapian)

* POP3 server, since some webmail providers support external POP3:
  https://public-inbox.org/meta/20160411034104.GA7817@dcvr.yhbt.net/

* TLS support for various daemons (including STARTTLS for NNTP and POP3)

* Unix socket support for HTTP and POP3 server for use behind reverse
  proxies like nginx

* Combined "super server" for NNTP/HTTP/POP3 to reduce memory overhead

* Optional reply-to-list support for mirroring lists that want it :<
  Reply-to-list encourages the existing list as a single-point-of-failure,
  but having an extra mirror using public-inbox.org is nice regardless.

* Configurable linkification for per-inbox shorthands:
  "$gmane/123456" could be configured to expand to the
  appropriate link pointing to the gmane.org list archives,
  likewise "[Bug #123456]" could be configured to expand to
  point to some project's bug tracker at http://example.com/bug/123456

* Support optional "HTTPS Everywhere" for mapping old HTTP to HTTPS
  links if (and only if) the user wants to use HTTPS.  We may also
  be able to configure redirects for expired URLs.

  Note: message bodies rendered as HTML themselves must NOT change,
  the links should point to an anchor tag within the same page,
  instead; giving the user options.

* implement RFC 4685 (Atom message threading)

* configurable constants (index limits, search results)

* use tags as date-based skiplists for navigating history
  (maybe not needed with Xapian support nowadays?)

* handle Xapian date range queries:
  http://mid.gmane.org/20151005222157.GE5880@survex.com

* use REQUEST_URI properly for CGI / mod_perl2 compatibility
  with Message-IDs which include '%' (done?)

* more test cases (use git fast-import to speed up creation)

* large mbox/Maildir/MH/NNTP spool import (use git fast-import)
