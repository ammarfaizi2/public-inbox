A small, bugfix release on top of 1.6.0 from September 2020.

Bug fixes:

* MIME header decoding no longer warns on undefined variables,
  with Perl <5.28.  Thanks to a bug report by Ali Alnubani.

* Fixed a message threading bug thanks to a report from Kyle Meyer.
  "public-inbox-index --rethread --reindex" will be necessary
  in case of certain messages arrive out-of-order.

* WWW: per-inbox grokmirror manifests no longer return info
  for all inboxes, only the root /manifest.js.gz includes all
  inboxes.  This regression appeared in 1.6.

* public-inbox-mda matches List-Id headers insensitively,
  matching public-inbox-watch behavior.  Similarly, List-Id
  is always indexed lower-cased for boolean matches to avoid
  matching an incorrect term.

* Newsgroup and Path NNTP headers are now emitted in conformance
  with RFC 5536 3.1.[45].  Thanks to Andrey Melnikov for the report:

* Inotify fixes for public-inbox-imapd users relying on SIGHUP
  reloads and thousands of watches.

* Read-only daemon fixes around TLS and Linux <4.5 systems

Bugfixes with minor behavior changes:

* The X-Status mbox header is now excluded from imports,
  just like the Status: header has been for many years.
  They have no place in public archives and can be privacy
  concern for people sharing archives.

* WWW prevents deep-linking to attachments to limit abuse
  vectors.  Noticed by Leah Neukirchen:

There are also several ocumentation fixes from Uwe Kleine-KÃ¶nig
and Kyle Meyer.
