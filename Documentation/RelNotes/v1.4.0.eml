Subject: [WIP] public-inbox 1.4.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8

This release focuses on reproducibility improvements and
bugfixes for corner-cases.  Busy instances of PublicInbox::WWW
may also notice memory usage reductions.

Rare messages lacking Date and/or Received headers, mirrors now
fallback to using the git author/commit times to reindex those
messages to ensure search and filtering queries behave the same
in mirrors as they do on the original machine.

"altid" SQLite dumps are now accessible to all over the WWW
interface via `POST /$INBOX/$ALTID.sql.gz'.

Busy instances of PublicInbox::WWW (whether via
public-inbox-httpd or another PSGI server) may notice
significant memory usage reductions from the single message
"permalink" lifetime optimization.  There also ongoing work to
improve memory lifetime management to reduce the potential for
memory fragmentation in daemons.

* general changes:

  - `include.*' directives in the public-inbox-config(5) file
    are now honored as documented in git-config(1),
    thanks to Andreas Rottmann.

  - `+0000' is assumed for dates missing TZ offsets;
    thanks to Leah Neukirchen for spotting this regression from
    v1.2.0.

  - `<' and `>' characters are dropped to avoid errors in git
    in addresses for git, thanks again to Leah for noticing
    this long-standing bug.

* PublicInbox::WWW:

  - reduced memory use for single message "permalink" view
  - code preload improved to reduce memory fragmentation
  - remove redundant "a=" parameter in links to solver
  - escape '&' in hrefs properly
  - fix optional address obfuscation in search results
  - `POST /$INBOX/$ALTID.sql.gz' endpoint to retrieve SQLite dumps

* public-inbox-httpd + public-inbox-nntpd:

  - fix SIGUSR2 upgrade in worker-less instances (-W0)

* public-inbox-httpd:

  - fix RFC 7230 conformance when Content-Length and "chunked"
    are both specified

* public-inbox-index:

  - reproduce original date and time stamps in mirrors for messages
    lacking Date: and/or Received: headers

  - new `--compact' (or `-c') switch to perform the equivalent of
    public-inbox-compact(1) after indexing each inbox

* documentation:

  - Documentation/technical/data_structures.txt add for new hackers.
