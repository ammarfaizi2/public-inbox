This release focuses on reproducibility improvements and
bugfixes for corner-cases.  Busy instances of PublicInbox::WWW
may also notice memory usage reductions.

For rare messages lacking Date and/or Received headers, mirrors
now fall back to using the git author/commit times to reindex
them.  This ensures search and filtering queries behave
identically on mirrors as they do on the original machine.

"altid" SQLite dumps are now accessible to all over the WWW
interface via `POST /$INBOX/$ALTID.sql.gz'.

Busy instances of PublicInbox::WWW (whether via
public-inbox-httpd or another PSGI server) may notice
significant memory usage reductions from the single message
"permalink" lifetime optimization.  There also ongoing work to
improve memory lifetime management to reduce the potential for
memory fragmentation in daemons.

* general changes:

  - `include.*' directives in the public-inbox-config(5) file
    are now honored as documented in git-config(1),
    thanks to Andreas Rottmann.

  - `+0000' is assumed for dates missing TZ offsets;
    thanks to Leah Neukirchen for spotting this regression from
    v1.2.0.

  - `<' and `>' characters are dropped to avoid errors in git
    in addresses for git, thanks again to Leah for noticing
    this long-standing bug.

* PublicInbox::WWW:

  - memory reductions for message display and rendering
  - code preload improved to reduce memory fragmentation
  - remove redundant "a=" parameter in links to solver
  - escape '&' in hrefs properly
  - fix optional address obfuscation in search results
  - `POST /$INBOX/$ALTID.sql.gz' endpoint to retrieve SQLite dumps

* public-inbox-httpd + public-inbox-nntpd:

  - fix SIGUSR2 upgrade in worker-less instances (-W0)

* public-inbox-httpd:

  - fix RFC 7230 conformance when Content-Length and "chunked"
    are both specified

* public-inbox-index:

  - reproduce original date and time stamps in mirrors for messages
    lacking Date: and/or Received: headers

  - new `--compact' (or `-c') switch to perform the equivalent of
    public-inbox-compact(1) after indexing each inbox

* documentation:

  - add Documentation/technical/data_structures.txt for new hackers

* scripts/import_vger_from_mbox: (not really a production-level script)

  - fix ">From" unescaping thanks to a bug report from Kyle Meyer

Thanks to Andreas Rottmann, Leah Neukirchen and Kyle Meyer
