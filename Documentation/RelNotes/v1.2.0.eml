Message-ID: <20191103030500.public-inbox-1.2.0@released>

* first non-pre/rc release with v2 format support for scalability.
  See public-inbox-v2-format(5) manpage for more details.

* new admin tools for v2 inboxes:
  - public-inbox-convert - converts v1 to v2 repo formats
  - public-inbox-compact - v2 convenience wrapper for xapian-compact(1)
  - public-inbox-purge - purges entire messages out of v2 history
  - public-inbox-edit - edits sensitive data out messages from v2 history
  - public-inbox-xcpdb - copydatabase(1) wrapper to upgrade Xapian formats
                         (e.g. from "chert" to "glass") and resharding
                         of v2 inboxes

* SQLite3 support decoupled from Xapian support, and Xapian DBs may be
  configured without phrase support to save space.  See "indexlevel" in
  public-inbox-config(5) manpage for more info.

* codebase now uses Perl 5.10.1+ features (e.g. "//")

* public-inbox-nntpd
  - support STARTTLS and NNTPS
  - support COMPRESS extension
  - fix several RFC3977 compliance bugs
  - improved interopability with picky clients such as leafnode
    and Alpine

* public-inbox-watch
  - support multiple spam training directories
  - support mapping multiple inboxes per Maildir
  - List-ID header support (see "listid" in public-inbox-config(5))

* public-inbox-mda
  - List-ID header support (see above)

* PublicInbox::WWW
  - grokmirror-compatible manifest.js.gz endpoint generation
  - user-configurable color support in $INBOX_URL/_/text/color/
  - BOFHs may set default colors via "publicinbox.css"
    (see public-inbox-config(5))
  - ability to map git code repositories and run cgit
    (see "coderepo" and "cgitrc" in public-inbox-config(5))
  - able to recreate blobs with coderepo associations and Xapian
  - search results may be reversed
  - reduce memory usage when rendering large threads
  - syntax highlighting for patches and blobs

* public-inbox-httpd / public-inbox-nntpd:
  - lower memory usage in C10K scenarios
  - buffers slow clients to filesystem (TMPDIR) instead of RAM
  - improved FreeBSD support
  - Danga::Socket is no longer a runtime dependency

* many documentation updates, new manpages for:
  - PublicInbox::SaPlugin::ListMirror
  - public-inbox-init
  - public-inbox-learn

* workaround memory leaks on Perl 5.16.3 (on CentOS/RHEL 7.x)
