Subject: [WIP] public-inbox 1.6.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Disposition: inline

* General changes:

  - ~/.cache/public-inbox/inline-c is automatically used for Inline::C
    if it exists.  PERL_INLINE_DIRECTORY in env remains supported
    and prioritized to support `nobody'-type users without HOME.

  - msgmap.sqlite3 uses journal_mode=TRUNCATE, matching over.sqlite3
    behavior for a minor reduction in VFS traffic

  - message/{rfc822,news,global} attachments are decoded recursively
    and indexed for search.  Use `public-inbox-index --reindex' to
    ensure these attachments are indexed in old messages.

* public-inbox-index

  - --batch-size=BYTES or publicinbox.indexBatchSize parameter

  - parallelize updates by default, "-j0" is (once again) allowed
    parallelization

* public-inbox-learn

  - `rm' supports `--all' to remove from all configured inboxes

* PublicInbox::WWW

  - use consistent blank line around attachment links

  - Attachments in message/{rfc822,news,global} messages can be
    individually downloaded.  Downloading the entire message/rfc822
    file in full remains supported

  - $INBOX_DIR/description is treated as UTF-8
