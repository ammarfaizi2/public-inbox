After some 3.5 odd years of working on this, I suppose now is
as good a time as any to tar this up and call it 1.0.0.

The TODO list is still very long and there'll be some new
development in coming weeks :>

So, here you have a release:

        https://public-inbox.org/releases/public-inbox-1.0.0.tar.gz

Checksums, mainly as a safeguard against accidental file corruption:

	(in other words, don't trust me; instead read the code :>)
