Subject: [WIP] public-inbox 1.5.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Disposition: inline

This release introduces a new pure-Perl lazy email parser,
PublicInbox::Eml, which uses roughly 10% less memory and
is up to 2x faster than Email::MIME.   This is a major
internal change

Limits commonly enforced by MTAs are also enforced in the
new parser, as messages may bypass MTA transports.

Email::MIME and other Email::* modules are no longer
dependencies nor used at all outside of maintainer validation
tests.

* public-inbox-index

  - `--max-size=SIZE' CLI switch and `publicinbox.indexMaxSize'
    config file option added to prevent indexing of overly
    large messages.

  - List-Id headers are indexed in new messages, old messages
    can be found after `--reindex'.

* public-inbox-watch

  - multiple values of `publicinbox.<name>.watchheader' are
    now supported, thanks to Kyle Meyer

  - List-Id headers are matched case-insensitively as specified
    by RFC 2919

* PublicInbox::WWW

  - $INBOX_DIR/description and $INBOX_DIR/cloneurl are not
    memoized if missing

  - improved display of threads, thanks to Kyle Meyer

  - search for List-Id is available via `l:' prefix if indexed

  - all encodings are preloaded at startup to reduce fragmentation

  - diffstat linkification and highlighting are stricter and
    less likely to linkify tables in cover letters

  - fix hunk header links to solver which were off-by-one line,
    thanks again to Kyle Meyer
