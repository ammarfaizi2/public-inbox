Subject: [WIP] public-inbox 1.7.0
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Disposition: inline

Another big release focused on multi-inbox search and scalability.

* general changes

  config file parsing is 2x faster with 50K inboxes

* read-only public-inbox-daemon (-httpd, -nntpd, -imapd):

  libgit2 may be used via Inline::C to avoid hitting system pipe
  and process limits.  See public-inbox-tuning(7) manpage
  for more details.

* public-inbox-extindex

  A new Xapian + SQLite index able to search across several inboxes.
  This may be configured to replace per-inbox Xapian DBs,
  (but not per-inbox SQLite indices) and speed up manifest.js.gz
  generation.

  See public-inbox-extindex-format(5) and
  public-inbox-extindex(1) manpages for more details.

* public-inbox-nntpd

  - startup is 6x faster with 50K inboxes if using -extindex

* PublicInbox::WWW

  - mboxrd search results are returned in reverse Xapian docid order,
    so more recent results are more likely to show up first

  - d: and dt: search prefixes allow "approxidate" formats supported
    by "git log --since="

  - manifest.js.gz generation is ~25x faster with -extindex

* lei - local email interface

  An experimental, subject-to-change, likely-to-eat-your-mail tool for
  personal mail as well as interacting with public-inboxes on the local
  filesystem or over HTTP(S).  See lei(1), lei-overview(7), and other
  lei-* manpages for details.

* public-inbox-watch

  - IMAP and NNTP code shared with lei, fixing an off-by-one error
    in IMAP synchronization for single-message IMAP folders.

  - \Deleted and \Draft messages ignored for IMAP, as they are for
    Maildir.

  - IMAP and NNTP connection establishment (including git-credential
    prompts) ordering is now tied to config file order.

Compatibility:

* Rollbacks all the way to public-inbox 1.2.0 remain supported

Internal changes

* public-inbox-index switched to new internal IPC code shared
  with lei
