=head1 NAME

lei - local email interface for public-inbox

=head1 SYNOPSIS

lei [OPTIONS] COMMAND

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Unlike the C10K-oriented L<public-inbox-daemon(8)>, lei is designed
exclusively to handle trusted local clients with read/write access to
the file system, using as many system resources as the local user has
access to.  lei supports a local, writable store built on top of
L<public-inbox-v2-format(5)> and L<public-inbox-extindex(1)>.
L<lei-q(1)> provides an interface for querying messages across the lei
store and read-only local and remote "externals" (inboxes and external
indices).

Available in public-inbox 1.7.0+.
