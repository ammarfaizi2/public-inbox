=head1 NAME

lei - local email interface

=head1 SYNOPSIS

lei [OPTIONS] COMMAND

=head1 DESCRIPTION

lei is a command-line tool for importing and searching email,
regardless of whether it is from a personal mailbox or a public-inbox.
lei supports a local, writable store built on top of
L<public-inbox-v2-format(5)> and L<public-inbox-extindex(1)>.
L<lei-q(1)> provides an interface for querying messages across the lei
store and read-only local and remote "externals" (inboxes and external
indices).

Warning: lei is still in its early stages and may destroy mail.
Be sure to have backups of destinations lei writes to.

Available in public-inbox 1.7.0+.
