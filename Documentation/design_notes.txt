Design notes and philosophy
---------------------------

public-inbox spawned around some basic ideas
--------------------------------------------

* Public, non-real-time, archivable communication is essential to
  Free and Open Source software development.

* Contributing to Free and Open Source projects should not require the
  use of non-Free/non-Open Source services or software.

* Graphical user interfaces should not be required for text-based
  communication.

Challenges to running normal mailing lists
------------------------------------------
1) spam
2) bounce processing of invalid/bad email addresses
3) processing subscribe/unsubscribe requests

Issues 2) and 3) are side-stepped entirely by moving reader
subscriptions to git repository synchronization and Atom feeds.  There's
no chance of faked subscription requests and no need to deal with
confused users who cannot unsubscribe.

Use existing infrastructure
---------------------------

* public-inbox can coexist with existing mailing lists, any subscriber
  to the existing mailing list can begin delivering messages to
  public-inbox-mda(1)

* public-inbox uses SMTP for posting.  Posting a message to a public-inbox
  instance is no different than sending a message to any _open_ mailing
  list.  Any existing spam filtering on an SMTP server is also effective
  on public-inbox.

* readers may continue using use their choice of mail clients and
  mailbox formats, only learning a few commands of the ssoma(1) tool
  is required.

* Atom is a reasonable feed format for casual readers and is supported
  by a variety of feed readers.

Why email?
----------

* Freedom from proprietary services, tools and APIs.  Communicating with
  developers and users of Free Software should not rely on proprietary
  tools or services.

* Existing infrastrucuture, tools, and user familarity.
  There is already a large variety of tools, clients, and email providers
  available.  There are also many resources for users to run their own
  SMTP server on a domain they control.

* All public discussion mediums are affected by spam and advertising.
  There exist several good Free Software anti-spam tools for email.

* Privacy is not an issue for public discussion.  Public mailing list
  archives are common and accepted by Free Software communities.
  There is no need to ask the NSA for backups of your mail archives :)

* git, one of the most widely-used version control systems, includes many
  tools for for email: git-format-patch(1), git-send-email(1), git-am(1).
  Furthermore, the development of git itself is based on the git mailing
  list.

* Email is already the de-facto form of communication in many Free Software
  communities.

* Fallback/transition to private email and other lists, in case the
  public-inbox host becomes unavailable, users may still directly email
  each other (or Cc: lists for related/dependent projects).

Why git?
--------

* git is distributed and robust while being both fast and
  space-efficient with text data.  NNTP was considered, but does not
  support compression and places no guarantees on data/transport
  integrity.  However, an NNTP gateway (read-only?) is possible.

* As of 2014, git is widely used and known to nearly all Free Software
  developers.  For non-developers it is packaged for all major GNU/Linux
  and *BSD distributions.

Web notes
---------

* Getting users to install/run ssoma (or any new tool) is difficult.
  The web views must be easily read/cache/mirror-able.

* There may also be a significant number of webmail users without
  an MUA or feed reader; so a web view is necessary.

* Expose Message-ID in web views to encourage replies from drive-by
  contributors.

* Raw text endpoint allows users to write client-side JS endpoints
  without hosting the data themselves (or on a different server).
