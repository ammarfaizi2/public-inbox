hacking public-inbox
--------------------

Send all patches via to our self-hosting inbox at meta@public-inbox.org
It is archived at <http://public-inbox.org/meta/>.

Please consider our goals in mind:

	Decentralization, Accessibility, Compatibility, Performance

These goals apply to everyone: users viewing over the web or NNTP,
sysadmins running public-inbox, and other hackers working public-inbox.

We will reject any feature which advocates or contributes to a particular
instance of a public-inbox becoming a single point of failure.

See design_www.txt and design_notes.txt in the Documentation/ directory
for design decisions made during development.
