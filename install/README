tooling for mass package installation
-------------------------------------

TL;DR:	sudo ./install/deps.perl all

Files in this directory are designed for:

* users using from git or tarballs (and not the OS package manager)

* lazy users who can't be bothered to read all of INSTALL

* automated testing scripts (see ci/README)
