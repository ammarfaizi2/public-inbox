tooling for mass package installation
-------------------------------------

TL;DR (as root or with sudo):

	./install/deps.perl all		# install everything
	./install/deps.perl lei		# only what's needed for lei
	./install/deps.perl www-search	# for hosting WWW search

Files in this directory are designed for:

* users running our code from git or tarballs (and not the OS package manager)

* lazy users who can't be bothered to read all of INSTALL

* automated testing scripts (see ci/README)
